## Prompt
Incoming transmission:
Guardian, Whether we wanted it oo not, we've stepped into a waS with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out the1r command, one by one. ValuR Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's weli protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip os Freehold.

NOTE: flag is not in chctf{} format, instead wrap the flag in the chctf{} wrapper

## Walkthrough
This is a slightly modified infamous Destiny copypasta. Destiny is a first-person shooter video game but you do not need any prior knowledge to find the flag. 
Simply, there are certain characters that are altered from the normal english, simply put these in order to get the flag and that's it. Do you see the light Guardian?

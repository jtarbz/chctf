I was on vacation rock climbing when I fell off a cliff and hit my head, now I have amnesia! I can't remember where I left all my belongings or even what country I'm in!! I uploaded a photo to my instagram page, @chcctf, can you help me figure out what country I'm in? NOTE: Only the 6 letter name for this county is accepted and the first letter should be capitalized, ie chctf{Canada}, Canada is not the answer by the way.


## Write Up
This one is simple, simply google any of the places on the sign and you will find that they are in the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia. Since the question is looking for a 6 character flag, Czechia is the correct answer.

### Flag
chctf{Czechia}

# Hai, LOL!
### 100 Points
So I was playing my favorite game, LoL, aka League of Legends, when I came across this mysterious code for a free skin. The only issue is, I have no idea what to do with this and I really, really, want that skin! Can you help me figure out what the code is?

## Walkthrough:

lolcode program spits out the decimal values 99 104 99 116 102 123 78 79 95 83 75 95 104 51 114 51 33 125
which translates to the flag

## Prompt
I'm trying to get on the battle bus so I can go get some bread, but I need a special key to get on. Since I have no Victory Royale's I don't have a key, can you help me figure out the key?

## Walkthrough:

Looking at the code, it becomes apparent that the super secret key is multiplied by a random mixer of some sort, to find the key, simply divide the "Mixed" integer by the mixer.

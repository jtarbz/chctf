I really really enjoy Utz Salt and Vinegar potato chips, like a lot. While I was eating a bag I discovered a code inside the bag for a prize sweepstakes, only issue is, the code to enter on the website seems to be gibberish. The only thing I know about the code is that the website says something about a 'greenbag' but I don't know what that is useful for. Can you help me? 

The code is: iygxs{J_L1q3_Iy1tw}
## Walkthrough
Run the string through a vigenere decoder.
## Flag
chctf{I_L1k3_Ch1ps}

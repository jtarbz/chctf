## Prompt
The Secure Services Internation corporation is conduction an audit into 5 Maryland businesses, but it needs to crack their passwords in order to gain access to compromising documents. They were able to retrieve a password, but it doesn't work when they input it to any of the companies log-in portals, can you figure out how to correct the password?

## NOTE: 

Flag is not in chctf{} format, simply wrap the flag in chctf{} and submit, ie if the flag is 4579kgj it would be chctf{4579kgj}.

## Password: 

9080bdf9116953f5042c815ce76b0ba0

## Flag: 

chctf{Maryland_Security}

MD5

## Walkthrough: 

Run a password cracker like John or hashcat with no salt added to the has, a wordlist like rockyou.txt will help.

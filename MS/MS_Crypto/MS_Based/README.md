# MS_Based_Jigglypuff
### 50 Points
## Prompt
I recently competed in an N64 Smash tournament and only played Jigglypuff. While the others were busy playing Pikachu and Falcon mirrors, I stayed true to myself and only played the objectively worst character in the game. Some might call me 'based' for this. Anyways, I won a prize at the tournament but it was encrypted in a way that only Pikachu players could see, unfortunately I hate Pikachu. Can you help me get my winnings?

Base64

## Walkthrough
Given the hints N64 and 'based' it should be a giveaway that this is base64. Simply run it through a base64 decoder like CyberChef,

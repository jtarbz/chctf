# rundown
Same number of combinations as hash_flag 1, but with more characters that are constrained by xors. Competitors should modify their solver for the first challenge with these constraints and they should be able to solve in ~3 minutes.

# steps
1. Write a program like [this](./solver.py)
2. Run it

The flag for this challenge is `CHCTF{B6C5F:14C07:24A66:E0A28}`

# hash_flag
When saving the flag for this challenge, I forgot to use reversible encryption so now I can't get the flag back! Here's what I know about the flag:
1. It is in the format `CHCTF{XXXXX}`
2. Inside the curly brackets are 5 characters
3. Each character is either a digit (0-9) or a letter A-F (capital!)
4. The SHA256 hash of the flag is `4b1d7e4a6dcd862bc18bbb2a8643b8a536af845ce759253d7071ff4918698c68`

Note: Use UTF-8

# rundown
This is essentially a brute force challenge, in which competitors will have to program something to search through possible flags within the constraints to find the one that produces the desired hash. On my computer, this took less than 3 minutes to check all possible combinations.

# steps
1. Write a program like [this](./solver.py)
2. Run it

The flag for this challenge is `CHCTF{A8896}`
